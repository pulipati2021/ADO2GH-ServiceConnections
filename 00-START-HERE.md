```

**Check it out:** https://github.com/pulipati2021/ADO2GH-ServiceConnections

## What's NOT in v4.0 (By Design)

❌ Service connection creation (Azure DevOps API can't do OAuth)  
❌ Automated webhook creation (happens automatically)  
❌ Pipeline YAML updates (needs manual review)  
❌ Complex menus (kept simple)  

**Why?** Simpler is better. Everything else is manual anyway.

## Time to Run

**First time:** 10 minutes  
**With multiple repos:** 15 minutes  
**Total setup:** < 20 minutes  

---

## No More:

❌ Confusing 11-option menus  
❌ Multiple REST API attempts  
❌ Complex error handling  
❌ Scattered documentation  
❌ Unclear variable names  
❌ Overcomplicated workflow  

---

## Now You Have:

✅ Simple 4-step workflow  
✅ Clear, readable code  
✅ Complete documentation  
✅ Auto-filling CSV  
✅ Action logging  
✅ Production ready  
✅ Easy to modify later
